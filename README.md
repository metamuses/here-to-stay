# Here To Stay

Group project for the Open Access and Digital Ethics 2025/26 course.

Here To Stay is a Linked Open Data project reflecting on the phenomenon of
touristification in the city of Bologna. In this context, the limited
availability of housing is a well-known issue for students and, more broadly,
for families. The aim of the project is to explore the relationship between these
two dynamics and to reflect on the social impacts of the increasing flow of
visitors in the city, producing informed conclusions and graphical visualizations
to showcase the data analysis.

The site of the project is live at [metamuses.github.io/here-to-stay](https://metamuses.github.io/here-to-stay).
